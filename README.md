# EVChargerProject
This project aims to create an AI-powered Electric Vehicle (EV) charging network that optimizes charging schedules and energy supply to reduce carbon emissions, lower energy costs, and improve grid stability. The system uses machine learning models to analyze grid conditions, renewable energy availability, and user driving behavior, ultimately providing personalized charging recommendations and ensuring energy-efficient operation.

Features:
Energy Supply Optimization: Aligns charging activities with grid availability and renewable energy supply (e.g., solar, wind).
Personalized Charging Schedules: AI analyzes user behavior to recommend optimal charging times based on driving habits and trip data.
Renewable Energy Integration: Prioritizes charging when renewable energy is abundant, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
Cost Optimization: Recommends off-peak charging to minimize energy costs for users.
Grid Load Balancing: Predicts energy demand and balances it across different locations to prevent grid congestion.
